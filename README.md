**More than just a calendar. It's a personal day-planning assistant, crafted with a deep love for design and user experience.**

Caliinda is my personal project, born from the desire to merge the robust functionality of Google Calendar with a genuinely beautiful, intuitive, and *alive* interface. I believe that planning your daily routine shouldn't be a chore, and this project is my vision of how everyday tasks can become an aesthetic pleasure.

### ✨ It's All About the UI/UX!

I've poured my passion for design into every detail, from the smooth animations to the selected color palettes and fonts. The goal is to create an app that you *want* to open every day.
The core design lays in latest Material 3 Expressive from Google.
